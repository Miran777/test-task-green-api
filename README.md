Get Start:
First, download the zip archive of the project.
Then unzip and open the folder in a code editor.
Then enter 2 commands in the console:
1. npm install
2.npm start

To use the program, you must first register on the site https://green-api.com.
Then create a developer instance and go to this profile.
In the profile settings, you must enable notifications for receiving messages.
You also need to link the instance to your WhatsApp in order to be able to send and receive messages from your profile.

And so, when you have already launched the program and registered on the GREEN-API service, you can start testing.
In the "data" section, enter the idInstance and apiTokenInstance that you can get from your GREEN-API profile, then enter the number you want to chat with. Just keep in mind that for this to work, you must be authorized in the GREEN-API service. Everything worked out!
